This is the monorepo for the Saha programming language.

    /// Application entrypoint.
    function main() int
    {
        // Say hello politely
        print(value = "Hello world!");

        // Just return an integer
        return 0;
    }

Saha is a general purpose programming language with the following basic features
acting as the basis for development:

-   Static typing
-   Functions
-   Objects
-   Behaviors (interfaces)
-   Lean core/standard library, easy to extend with extensions and libraries
